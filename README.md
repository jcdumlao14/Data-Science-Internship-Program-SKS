# ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Data Preparation

## Description:

In this task, I loaded the dataset and conducted an initial exploration. I handled missing values, transformed categorical variables into numerical representations, and split the dataset into training and testing sets for further model evaluation.

## Skills Gained:
âœ… Data loading, data exploration

âœ… Handling missing values

âœ… Data preprocessing

âœ… Categorical variable encoding

âœ… Dataset splitting

# ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Description:

In this task, I calculated and visually represented the overall churn rate. I explored customer distribution by gender, partner status, and dependent status. Additionally, I analyzed tenure distribution and its relationship with churn, and examined how churn varies across different contract types and payment methods.

## Skills Gained:
âœ… Data visualization

âœ… statistical analysis

âœ… Exploratory data analysis

âœ… Understanding of customer demographic 

âœ… Churn rate calculation

#ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Customer Segmentation

## Description:

In this task, I segmented customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type. I analyzed churn rates within each segment and identified high-value customers who are at risk of churning and might need special attention.

## Skills Gained:
âœ… Customer Segmentation Techniques

âœ… Understanding Customer Behavior
âœ… Churn Analysis Within Segments
âœ… Identifying High-Value Customers
