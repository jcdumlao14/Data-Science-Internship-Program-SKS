## 🔹 Task 1: Data Preparation

### 📝 Description:

In this task, I loaded the dataset and conducted an initial exploration. I handled missing values, transformed categorical variables into numerical representations, and split the dataset into training and testing sets for further modeling.

### 💡 Skills Gained:
✅ Data loading and exploration  
✅ Missing value handling  
✅ Categorical encoding  
✅ Data preprocessing  
✅ Train-test data splitting

## 🔹 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 📝 Description:

In this task, I calculated and visually represented the overall churn rate. I explored customer distribution by gender, partner status, and dependent status. Additionally, I analyzed tenure distribution and its relationship with churn, and examined how churn varies across different contract types and payment methods.

### 💡 Skills Gained:
✅ Data Visualization  
✅ Statistical Analysis  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Understanding Customer Demographics  
✅ Churn Rate Calculation

## 🔹 Task 3: Customer Segmentation

### 📝 Description:

In this task, I segmented customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type. I analyzed churn rates within each segment and identified high-value customers who are at risk of churning and might need special attention.

### 💡 Skills Gained:
✅ Customer Segmentation Techniques  
✅ Understanding Customer Behavior  
✅ Churn Analysis Within Segments  
✅ Identifying High-Value Customers

## 🔹 Task 4: Churn Prediction Model

### Description:

In this task, I selected suitable machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees and random forest to predict customer churn. I split the data into training and testing sets, trained and evaluated several models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also worked on feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.

## 🔹 Task 5: Model Evaluation and Interpretation

### Description:

In this task, I evaluated the best-performing predictive model using the testing dataset. I interpreted model coefficients and feature importance to understand the key factors influencing customer churn. I also created ROC curves and calculated the AUC to assess model performance.

## 🔹 Task 6: Business Recommendations

### Description:
Based on the analysis and predictive models, I provided practical recommendations to help the business improve customer retention. This included suggesting targeted marketing strategies, special retention offers, and customer engagement ideas. I also estimated how these recommendations could affect revenue and churn rate.
