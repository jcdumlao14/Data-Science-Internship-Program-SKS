## 📂 Dataset

We used the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset** provided by SaiKet Systems, which contains customer information including services used, tenure, charges, and churn status.

## 🔹 Task 1: Data Preparation

### 📝 Description:

In this task, I loaded the dataset and conducted an initial exploration. I handled missing values, transformed categorical variables into numerical representations, and split the dataset into training and testing sets for further modeling.

### 💡 Skills Gained:
✅ Data loading and exploration  
✅ Missing value handling  
✅ Categorical encoding  
✅ Data preprocessing  
✅ Train-test data splitting

## 🔹 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 📝 Description:

In this task, I calculated and visually represented the overall churn rate. I explored customer distribution by gender, partner status, and dependent status. Additionally, I analyzed tenure distribution and its relationship with churn, and examined how churn varies across different contract types and payment methods.

### 💡 Skills Gained:
✅ Data Visualization  
✅ Statistical Analysis  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Understanding Customer Demographics  
✅ Churn Rate Calculation

## 🔹 Task 3: Customer Segmentation

### 📝 Description:

In this task, I segmented customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type. I analyzed churn rates within each segment and identified high-value customers who are at risk of churning and might need special attention.

### 💡 Skills Gained:
✅ Customer Segmentation Techniques  
✅ Understanding Customer Behavior  
✅ Churn Analysis Within Segments  
✅ Identifying High-Value Customers
